## Source Code

*Welcome to the QuickBlocks source tree!*

QuickBlocks is a collection of software libraries, applications, and command-line tools designed to give you quick access to the data provided by an Ethereum node.

Our source code is laid out to reflect this. There are primarily four folder:

- **[The 'libs' folder.](./libs/README.md)** This folder holds the C++ library code that helps us build out various applications and command-line tools. All of this code is open source.

- **[The 'apps' folder.](./apps/README.md)** This folder contains source code for the primary applications that comprise the system. Some of this source code is currenlty not open source.

- **[The 'tools' folder.](./tools/README.md)** This folder contains source code for an open source collection of simple command line tools. These tools, while being very useful, serve primarily as sample code for the libraries.

- **[The 'samples' folder.](./samples/README.md)** This folder contains other open source sample source code for the system. You can get a lot of ideas here, but many of these samples are incomplete. Please add to the list and/or feel free to expand any of these samples.

- **[The 'other' folder.](./other/README.md)** This folder contains various other documents such as installation instructions, FAQs, and other tools you may find useful.

- Finally, **[the 'monitors' folder.](./monitors/README.md)**, which holds propietary code for monitoring, recording, replaying, debuging and accounting for smart contracts and builds per-account lists of transactions.
