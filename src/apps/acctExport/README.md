## acctExport

This folder contains a QBlocks monitor. QBlocks monitors pull transactions from the Ethereum blockchain for a given (or a series of) Ethereum addresses.

Below we present the command line interface to this tool, although the tool itself is not available under open source. While the tool is in active development, QBlocks monitors already produce very useful results. For example, we use QBlocks monitors to account for and analyze all transactions on a given smart contract. We present [this example](http://dao.quickblocks.io).

#### Other Options

All **QBlocks** command-line tools support the following commands (although in some case, they have no meaning):

    Command     |     Description
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --version   |   display the current version of the tool
    --nocolor   |   turn off colored display
    --wei       |   specify value in wei (the default)
    --ether     |   specify value in ether
    --dollars   |   specify value in US dollars
    --raw       |   report JSON data from the node with minimal processing
    --veryRaw   |   report JSON data from node with zero processing
    --fmt       |   export format (where appropriate). One of [none|txt|csv|json|api]
    --api_mode  |   simulate api_mode for testing
    --to_file   |   write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
    --output:fn |   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
    --file:fn   |   specify multiple sets of command line options in a file.

<small>*For the `--file:fn` option, place a series of valid command lines in a file and use the above options. In some cases, this option may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of a line makes that line a comment.*</small>
