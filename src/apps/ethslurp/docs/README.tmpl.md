## [{NAME}]

`ethslurp` is one of our older command line tools. It even has its [own website](http://ethslurp.com) and [video tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZDV1yAgces). While this tool is very useful, it has two significant flaws. First, it is not decentralized--in fact it is fully centralized, pulling its data from [http://etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io) as it does. The tool's second major flaw is that it does not pull every transaction from the chain for a given account as our [account monitors](../../monitors/README.md) do. This is because of `internal transactions` which, believe us, is too complicated to be worth taking the time to explain.

While `ethslurp` does have its shortcomings, it also provides some nice features. You can use it to pull all externally generated transactions against an account. You may also use the tool's fully customizable formatting options to export data into any format you wish. Visit the above referenced website for more information.
