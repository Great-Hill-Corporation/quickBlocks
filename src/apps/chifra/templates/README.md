This folder contains a QuickBlocks monitor. QuickBlocks monitors pull transactions from the Ethereum blockchain for a given (or a series of) Ethereum addresses.

While the tool is in active development, QuickBlocks monitors already produce very useful results. For example, we use QuickBlocks monitors to account for and analyze all transactions on a given smart contract. We present [this example](http://dao.quickblocks.io).
