## [{NAME}]

`chifra` is an interactive command line tool that builds a QuickBlocks account monitor program through an interactive series of questions. Given answers to these questions (such as which addresses to monitor, what to name those addresses, `chifra` builds both the parsing library needed to monitor the given addresses as well as an interative transactional debugging/accounting program. It does this through the use of [makeClass](../makeClass) and [grabABI](../grabABI).
