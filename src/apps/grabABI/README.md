## grabABI

`grabABI` retreives an ABI file either from a local cache, from ENS, or from [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io) and generates the classDefinition.txt files needed by [makeClass](../makeClass) to generated monitor libraries.

** Notes: **

There is also an option`--silent` that is useful for scripting. It causes the app to display fewer messages.

#### Usage

`Usage:`    grabABI [-c|-g|-e|-n|-o|-t|-v|-h] addr  
`Purpose:`  Fetches the ABI for a smart contract. Optionally generates C++ source code representing that ABI.
             
`Where:`  

| Option | Full Command | Description |
| -------: | :------- | :------- |
|  | addr | the address(es) of the smart contract(s) to grab |
| -c | --canonical | convert all types to their canonical represenation and remove all spaces from display |
| -g | --generate | generate C++ code into ':dir' for all functions and events found in the ABI |
| -e | --encode | generate the encodings for the functions / events in the ABI |
| -n | --noconst | generate encodings for non-constant functions and events only (always true when generating) |
| -o | --open | open the ABI file for editing, download if not already present |
| -t | --test | generate intermediary files but do not execute the commands |
| -v | --verbose | set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level |
| -h | --help | display this help screen |

#### Other Options

Enter `--version` to display the current version of the tool.  
Enter `--nocolors` to turn off colored display.  
Enter `--wei` (default), `--ether`, or `--dollars` to alter the way value is displayed.  

All `quickBlocks` command-line tools support the `--file:filename` option. Place valid commands, on separate lines, in a file and include the above option. In some cases, this option may significantly improve performance. Place a semi-colon at the start of a line to make it a comment.
