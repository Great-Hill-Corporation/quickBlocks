## [{NAME}]

`grabABI` retreives an ABI file either from a local cache, from ENS, or from [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io) and generates the classDefinition.txt files needed by [makeClass](../makeClass) to generated monitor libraries.

** Notes: **

There is also an option`--silent` that is useful for scripting. It causes the app to display fewer messages.
