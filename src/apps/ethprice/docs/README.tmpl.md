## [{NAME}]

The `ethprice` tool provides Ethereum price data to various **quickBlocks** tools or for other purposes. Currently, `ethprice` retrieves data using the Poloniex API. In future versions, we intend to add other sources of pricing data and provide a mechanism to specify an averaging calculate given multiple price sources. Ultimately, we hope Ethereum/fiat price data appears under consensus, but until that time, **quickBlocks** uses `ethprice`. Powered, in part, by Poloniex<sup>&reg;<sup>
