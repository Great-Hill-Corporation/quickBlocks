## [{NAME}]

The `ethprice` tool provides Ethereum price data to various `quickBlocks` tools or for other purposes. Currently, the tool retrieves data in five minute increments through the Poloniex API. In the future, we will add other sources of pricing data and provide mechanism to specify how to calculate price data given multiple sources. Ultimately, we presume this data will be provided under consensus, but until that time, we provide this tool.
