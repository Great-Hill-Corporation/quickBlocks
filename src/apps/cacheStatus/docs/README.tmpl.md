## cacheMan

The `cacheMan` program allows one to  manage and explore [monitor cache files](../../monitors/README.md). You may list cache entries, check for duplicate or invalid cache entries (and optionally remove them), and merge or unmerge one or more caches. Use the tool with caution and please make sure to backup your data before proceeding.
