#### Other Options

All QuickBlocks command-line tools support the following commands (although in some case, they have no meaning):

    Command     |         Description
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --version   |   display the current version of the tool
    --nocolors  |   turn off colored display
    --wei       |   specify value in wei (the default)
    --ether     |   specify value in ether
    --dollars   |   specify value in US dollars
    --file:fn   |   specify multiple sets of command line options in a file.

*For the `--file:fn` option, place a series of valid command lines in a file and use the above option. In some cases, this option may significantly improve performance. Use semi-colon make comments.*
