Given the address of an ERC20 token contract, report token balances for one or more accounts. Alternatively, report token balances for multiple ERC20 contracts for a single account.

In normal operation the **first item** in the `address_list` is considered to be an ERC20 token contract whose balances are queried, whereas the remainder of the list is assumed to be accounts on which to report.

In `--byAcct` mode, **all items** in the `address_list` are assumed to be token contracts, except the last which is the account whose token balances are reported.

You may optionally specify one or more blocks at which to report.
