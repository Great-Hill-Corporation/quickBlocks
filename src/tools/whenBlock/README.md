## whenBlock

The `whenBlock` tool answers one of two questions: (1) "When did a given block occur?" or (2) "What block occurred at or before a given date and time?"

In the first case, one simply supplies a block number and the date and time of that block is displayed. In the later case, one provides a date (and optionally time) and the block number that 
occurred at or just prior to that date and time is displayed.

Name your own blocks by editing '~./quickBlocks/whenBlock.toml' and placing `name=blockNum` pairs under the [SPECIAL] section of that file (create it if not present).

The `hour`/`minute`/`second` portions of the date are optional, and if omitted, default to zero in each case.

   Special values: [ iceage | homestead | daofund | daohack | daofork | tangerine | spurious | stateclear | latest ]

#### Other Options

Enter `--version` to display the current version of the tool.  
Enter `--nocolors` to turn off colored display.  
Enter `--wei` (default), `--ether`, or `--dollars` to alter the way value is displayed.  

All `quickBlocks` command-line tools support the `--file:filename` option. Place valid commands, on separate lines, in a file and include the above option. In some cases, this option may significantly improve performance. Place a semi-colon at the start of a line to make it a comment.
