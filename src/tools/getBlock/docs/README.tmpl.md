## [{NAME}]

The `getBlock` tool retrieves Ethereum block data from a running node or, if previously retrieved, the QuickBlocks cache. It optionally retrieves the hashes that denote the transactions in the block or the full transactional data as a default.

The tool may also be used to double check that the results produced from the QuickBlocks cache and the results as retrieved directly from the running node are identical (modulo the fact that QuickBlocks does not store every data field from the node). You may accomplish this `check` with the --check option.
