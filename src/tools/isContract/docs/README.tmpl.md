## [{NAME}]

This simple program may be used to query an Ethereum address to determine if it is a smart contract or simply a 'regular' account. It may also be used to retrieve the actual byte-code from an address (if code is present). Finally, it may be used to compare two addresses to determine if they hold identical 
code. You may specify multiple addresses on a line.

[{USAGE_TABLE}]*See Also*: This command-line tool implements the [eth_getCode](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/JSONRPC-eth-module#eth_getcode) RPC interface.
