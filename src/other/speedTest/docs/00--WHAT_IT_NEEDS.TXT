It should accept 'latest,' 'start,' 'end.'

There is a very large amount of duplicated data in the JSON. I should implement fromParent in makeClass to pick data up from parent (for example, blockNumber which 
exists four or five times in the data). Changing format will require reloading .bin files.

Also--the pParent should be used (it's already there). I can generate a getParent (per header file, not as part of the class) that will ASSERT that the parent is what 
we expect it to be and return the parent. To test this, I should see the .bin files get smaller (by a lot) but the JSON files be identical.
