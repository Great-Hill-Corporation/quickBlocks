1.	Run geth in a separate window
2.	For b in 0...2_750_000
		echo "eth_getBlock(i)" | get attach >b.json
3.	For b in 0...2_750_000
		read b.json
		write b.bin
4.	For b in 0...2_750_000
		fromGeth = read b.json
		fromSlurp = generate string_b from b.bin
		compare fromGeth with fromSlurp
		if (geth and slurp are perfect match)
			archive geth's original json
5.	Start auto_update
		each x mins ask geth for the latest block
		for b in lastBlock...latestBlock
			use RPC to ask geth for the block
			store b.bin
			store b.json to archive
		b = random list of 100 blocks between 0 and latest
			read directly from geth, compare the binary's json

First DAO Block:	1520861
Last DAO Block:		1599205


Trouble: bins may not contain full geth 1.5 blocks
	such as mixMatch, r, s, v and possibly others

I must turn on FULL_REPORT to expose mixMatch, r, s, v and unquote numbers as per Parity
