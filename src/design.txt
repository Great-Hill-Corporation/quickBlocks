Constant Per-Block Reconciliation of Smart Contract System

Introduction
Why is it Important
	Example of the DAO
	Example of Difficulty of Token Accounting
Sample Token Sales
	DAO
	Singular DTV
Why Per-Block Accounting is Important
How it Works
	On a recurring basis we
		1. Read the new blocks
		2. Cache the block data and process the transactions looking for internal transactions
		3. Confirm that the node balance at the previous block is the same as our ongoing balance
		4. Accumulate transactions
		5. Deduct gas usage
		6. Ask for account balance after block
	If anything doesnâ€™t work, report
Savings
Implications of Per-Block Reconciliation
	No-one will ever not monitor
	Cost of monitoring is minimal
	Cache data per account as three integers block, transaction, internal id
