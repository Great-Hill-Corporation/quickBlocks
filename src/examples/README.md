## Examples

The `examples` folder contains a small collection of example code that may help illustrate how to write your own programs using TrueBlocks. This is a community generated repository. If you wish to add to this folder, please make a pull request.

### Folders

The examples directly in the folder detail how to use TrueBlocks to write something like a command line tool. Other great sources for examples of command line tools are in the ./src/tools folder.

In the folder, `dynamic` are a few example of building [custom traversers](https://docs.trueblocks.io/blog/dynamic-traversers-for-trueblocks/). See the README in that folder for more information.
