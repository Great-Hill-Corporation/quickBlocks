## ./bin Folder

QuickBlocks is a series of C++ [libraries](../src/libs) and a collection of [tools](../src/tools) and [applications](../src/apps) built on those libraries. Once built, the tools and application binaries appear in this folder. Add this folder to your $PATH, and you will be able to run these programs.

##### Notes

Generall speaking, no files appear in this folder other than this README.md file and the built binaries. Do not upload any files to this folder.
