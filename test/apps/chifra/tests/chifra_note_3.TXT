Copied in from duplicate issue Great-Hill-Corporation/ethslurp#48 which was closed.

The first time an address is encountered, the program should ask a few questions. What do you want to name this contract? Is this a regular account or a contract? If 
it's a contract, can you provide the ABI interface? The program should work without these items, but it would be much easier if they were there. A command link could 
include the name of the contract or account instead of the address with is obviously impossible to remember. Also--with the ABI we will be able to parse the 'input' 
field. Without it, we can't.

From issue Great-Hill-Corporation/ethslurp#58 (closed):

I need: a) the address, b) the json ABI, c) a config file with the function* turned on
Store ABI in ~/.etshslurp/abis. Store config file in ~/.ethslurp/ADDRESS.dat, Add the file to a watch .slrp file
