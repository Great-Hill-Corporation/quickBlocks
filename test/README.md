# Tests Folder

This folder holds the results of the test cases that you may run from ./build by entering `make test`.

If you're running a fully-synchronized local node, all the tests should pass. If you are not running a local node, you may still run these tests, but many of them will fail.

You may change the rpcProvider to a remote Ethereum node if you're not running a local node.
