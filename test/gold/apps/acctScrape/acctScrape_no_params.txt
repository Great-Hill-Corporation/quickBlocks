	-m  (--maxBlocks val) the maximum number of blocks to visit during this run
	-o  (--oneBlock val)  check if the block would be a hit
	-n  (--oneTrans val)  check if the block and transaction would be a hit
	-w  (--writeBlocks)   write binary blocks to cache (default: do not write blocks)
	-m  (--maxBlocks val) scan at most --maxBlocks blocks ('all' implies scan to end of chain)
