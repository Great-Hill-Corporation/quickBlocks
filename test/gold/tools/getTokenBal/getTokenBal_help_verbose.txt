getTokenBal argc: 3 [1:--help] [2:-v] 
getTokenBal --help -v 

  Usage:    getTokenBal [-b|-l fn|-n|-d|-v|-h] <address> <address> [address...] [block...]  
  Purpose:  Retrieve the token balance(s) for one or more addresses at the given (or latest) block(s).
             
  Where:    
	address_list          two or more addresses (0x...), the first is an ERC20 token, balances for the rest are reported (required)
	block_list            an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'
	-b  (--byAcct)        consider each address an ERC20 token except the last, whose balance is reported for each token
	-l  (--list fn)       an alternative way to specify an address_list, place one address per line in the file 'fn'
	-n  (--noZero)        suppress the display of zero balance accounts
	-d  (--data)          render results as tab delimited data (for example, to build a cap table)
	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:  
	- addresses must start with '0x' and be forty characters long
	- block_list may be space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination
	- this tool retrieves information from the local node or the ${FALLBACK} node, if configured (see the documentation)
	- if the token contract(s) from which you request balances are not ERC20 compliant, the results are undefined
	- if the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined
	- special blocks are detailed under whenBlock --list
