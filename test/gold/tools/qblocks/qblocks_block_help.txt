getBlock argc: 3 [1:-h] [2:--qblocks] 
getBlock -h --qblocks 

  You must specify at least one block.

  Usage:    qblocks block [-r|-n|-c|-l|-a|-u|-l|-v|-h] <block> [block...]  
  Purpose:  Returns block(s) from local cache or directly from a running node.
             
  Where:    
	block_list            a space-separated list of one or more blocks to retrieve (required)
	-r  (--raw)           pull the block data from the running Ethereum node (no cache)
	-n  (--hash_only)     display only transaction hashes, default is to display full transaction detail
	-c  (--check)         compare results between qblocks and Ethereum node, report differences, if any
	-l  (--latest)        display the latest blocks at both the node and the cache
	-a  (--addrs)         display all addresses included in the block
	-u  (--uniq)          display only uniq addresses found in the block
	-l  (--filter val)    useful only for --addr or --uniq, only display this address in results

#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)
	-o  (--force)         force a re-write of the block to the cache
	-q  (--quiet)         do not print results to screen, used for speed testing and data checking
	-s  (--source val)    either :c(a)che or :(r)aw, source for data retrival. (shortcuts -c = qblocks, -r = node)
	-f  (--fields val)    either :(a)ll, (m)ini, (c)ache or :(r)aw; which fields to include in output (all is default)
	-n  (--normalize)     normalize (remove un-common fields and sort) for comparison with other results (testing)
#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)

	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen
