	-f  (or --fields)     either :(a)ll, (m)ini, (c)ache or :(r)aw; which fields to include in output (all is default)
	-p  (or --parity)     mimic parity output using quickBlocks (i.e. quoted hexidecimal for numbers)
	-r  (or --reciept)    
	-t  (or --terse)      retreive transaction hashes instead of full transactions
