getBlock -t 4001001 

  --terse options work only with --source:raw. Quitting...

  Usage:    getBlock [-k|-s|-f|-p|-t|-q|-v|-h] num  
  Purpose:  Returns block(s) from local cache (the default) or directly from a running node.
             
  Where:    
	num                   which block (or blocks if more than one) to retreive (or use [start-stop) for range) (required)
	-k  (--check)         pull block(s) using both cache and raw, compare results, report differences (should be none)
	-s  (--source val)    either :(c)ache or :(r)aw, source for data retrival. (shortcuts -c = qblocks, -r = node)
	-f  (--fields val)    either :(a)ll, (m)ini, (c)ache or :(r)aw; which fields to include in output (all is default)
	-p  (--parity)        mimic parity output using quickBlocks (i.e. quoted hexidecimal for numbers)
	-t  (--terse)         if source is raw, retreive transaction hashes instead of full transactions
	-q  (--quiet)         do not print results to screen, used for speed testing and data checking
	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen
