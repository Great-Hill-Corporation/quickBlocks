## Possible Test Cases

This is beginning list of possible test cases for open source blockchain explorers and/or address explorers. The goal of the following division is to keep make it clear what data come directly from the node without any manipulation, what data comes from manipulation by removing items from the raw data (very easy to verify), data easily derived from the raw data (including traces), and data that spans multiple blocks (or time series data). The reason for this last distinction is because dealing with individual blocks is easy to parallize. Providing test cases that are easily paralizable seems prudent.

There are various levels of possible test cases:

#### Raw Data Directly From the Node:

1. Block `blockNum` as returned by the RPC (I would strongly suggest including new lines in the results JSON to enable diff testing)
2. Block `hash` as above
3. Transaction `blockNum.transactionIndex` as above
4. Transaction `hash` formatted as above
5. Receipt for transaction `blockNum.transactionIndex`
6. Receipt for transaction `hash`

#### Data Derived from Raw Data by Removing Fields

1. Item 1-6 above with all `hashes` removed (greatly lessen disc space needed and the hashes can be re-derived)
2. Items 1-2 with `mining` related information removed (for regular auditing of accounts, there's no need to store uncle data for example)

#### Data Derived from Raw Data by Straigtforward Calcuation

1. A list (possibly containing duplicates) of every address involved in a block based on the filtering implied by the below lists: all, to, from, creations, suicides, event generator, event topic, event data, input data, etc.
2. A unique list of item 1.
3. Derived data from the block such as an enhanced adaptive bloom filter

#### Time Series Data

This type of data spans multiple blocks and is therefor more difficult to paralelize (presumably). There there are lists of data that cross block bounderies (i.e. time series data). In the below, when I say 'list of all transactions' what I mean is a simple tab seperated block-range-limited list of three data items per row:

    blockNum [tab] transactionIndex [tab] (optional traceID)
    
(Note: see important discussion of `traceId` [here](./possible EIPs.md))

1. List of all transactions `to` a regular and/or smart contract account (between blocks X and Y)
2. List of all transactions `from` a regular and/or smart contract account (between...)
3. List of all contract creations from a regular account
4. List of all contract creations by a smart contract
5. List of suicided smart contracts
6. List of events generated by a given address
7. List of events where a given address is a `topic`
8. List of events where a given address is in the `data`
9. List of transactions where a given address appears in the `input` data

#### Non-Blockchain Data Needed for Accounting / Auditing

There is a lot of non-blockchain data that is as immutable as other blockchain data such as price in US dollars on a given day. While this data is not verifiable in a 'blockchainy' way, it will eventually be standardized, so we could start that process now.
