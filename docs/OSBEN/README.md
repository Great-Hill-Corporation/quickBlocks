## Open Source Blockchain Explorer Test Cases / Possible EIPs

As part of the Open Source Blockchain initiative, I think it would be worthwhile to try to do two things:

1. **[Test Cases](./possible Test Cases.md)**. Build a collection of test cases that new entrants into the Open Source Blockchain space can use to get up to speed.

2. **[Possible EIPs](./possible EIPs.md)**. Build a collection of possible EIPs that will help the node core developers better supply data to end users.
