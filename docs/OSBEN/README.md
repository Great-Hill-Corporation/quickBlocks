## Open Source Blockchain Explorer Test Cases / Possible EIPs

As part of the Open Source Blockchain initiative, I think it would be worthwhile to try to do two things:

Build a collection of test cases that new entrants into the Open Source Blockchain space can use to get up to speed. [Link here](./possible Test Cases.md).

Build a collection of possible EIPs that will help the node core developers better supply data to end users. [Link here](./possible EIPs.md)
