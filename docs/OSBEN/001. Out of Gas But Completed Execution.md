#### Problem

	Web2Scan reports 9 in-error transactions on 8/13/2015, QuickBlocks reports 8
	
[This transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0d2721462c811b1cca23f7f1870aa318d6f6cce1453396c4abc922c2e9ad6c2f) called into a smart contract [0x6ffb4469de9d4a4118710ff6651933ee92f6b205](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ffb4469de9d4a4118710ff6651933ee92f6b205) that then called into another smart contract [0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e). That call ended in an `out of gas`. The calling smart contract seems to have caught the failed `call` and completed its operartion without further problems. This is evident from the fact that ether was exchanged and `gasUsed` is less than the `gasAllowed`.

#### Fix:

QuickBlocks now reports two different types of errors: (1) top level errors, and (2) errors in traces that did not bubble up to the top level. Suggestion: Web3Scan should report the number of errors at the top level, and the number of errors in the traces that did not bubbled up to the top level. For 8/13/2015, it should report 8 top level errors and one trace-level error that did not bubble up.

#### Notes:

Top level errors will always result in gasUsed being equal to gasAllowed, but this does not mean that if gasUsed == gasAllowed there has been an error. An error implies gasUsed==gasAllow, but not visa-versa.

#### Open Questions:

1. If an `out of gas` occurs on a `called` smart contract but the `calling` smart contract handles the error--and the operation of the `calling` smart contract does fail, should this be considered an error? QuickBlocks does not think so. (But the issue should be noted. This is how EtherScan handles it.)
2. Is it correct to say that, in this case, (and by extension, in general) an `out of gas` error may not revert all state changes. (I think the answer is clearly true).
3. In this example, the originating address sends the receiving smart contract 11 ether. That makes a call into another smart contract with 10 ether. That call fails. The 10 ether does not transfer, but the original 11 ether does.
