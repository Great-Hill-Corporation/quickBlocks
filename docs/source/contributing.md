Documentation
--------------

Help us document that project. While every folder in the project has a README.md file, many are inadequate or less that fully accurate. You may help in any of these 
ways:

- Resolve existing issues
- Post new issues to our GitHub account
- Answer an open question on our Slack
- Close an issue if it no longer present

Here is our `Git Hub <http://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks>`_.

Testing
--------

Write and document test code for any part of our system: librarys, tools, applications; whereever you think a test is needed.
Fix any broken test cases
Help us implement continuous test so the repo gets tests whenever we push new code
