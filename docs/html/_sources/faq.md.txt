Isn't this just web3.js? What's different?
--------------------------------------------

We will admit a bit of bias here. The first answer is: "It's Javascript". The second is this: QuickBlocks has two built in features that alleviate much of the work that every dApp developer has to do if they use web3.js. (1) if you want anything even approaching a responsive website, you must cache the results of your interactions with the Ethereum node, and (2) once you receive the hexadecimal mess of data sent by the RPC, you must parse that data to transaction it back to the language of your smart contract. While the first retrieval of data from the node with QuickBlocks is only slightly faster than web3.js, the second and subsequent retrievals as 40-60 times faster. And given the ABI for your contact, QuickBlocks can handle the entire parsing task deliver JSON data with votes and transfers instead of 0x10291200 and 0x02910902.

Why both command line tools and a software library?
