With TrueBlocks' admin component, you can query the status of the system,
and control the creation, sharing , and pinning of the TrueBlocks index of appearances.

Through the `chifra serve` command, you can also serve `chifra` subcommands as API endpoints.
You test this out from your `localhost` on our [API reference](https://www.tokenomics.io/api.html).
